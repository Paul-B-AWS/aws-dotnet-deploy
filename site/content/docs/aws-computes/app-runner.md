# AWS App Runner - fully managed service

* Supports deployments of containerized .NET applications to AWS App Runner.
* Recommended if you want to deploy your application as a container image on a fully managed environment.

> **Note: This compute requires a Dockerfile. IF YOUR PROJECT DOES NOT CONTAIN A DOCKERFILE, THE DEPLOYMENT TOOL WILL AUTOMATICALLY GENERATE IT,** otherwise an existing Dockerfile will be used.

[**AWS App Runner**](https://aws.amazon.com/apprunner/) is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to quickly deploy containerized web applications and APIs, at scale and with no prior infrastructure experience required. Start with your source code or a container image. App Runner builds and deploys the web application automatically, load balances traffic with encryption, scales to meet your traffic needs, and makes it easy for your services to communicate with other AWS services and applications that run in a private Amazon VPC. With App Runner, rather than thinking about servers or scaling, you have more time to focus on your applications.
