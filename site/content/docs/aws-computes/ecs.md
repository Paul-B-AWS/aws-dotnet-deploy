# Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) using AWS Fargate

* Supports deployments of .NET applications as a service (e.g. web application or a background processor) or as a scheduled task (e.g. end-of-day process) to Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) with compute power managed by AWS Fargate serverless compute engine.
* Recommended if you want to deploy a service or a scheduled task as a container image on Linux.

> **Note: This compute requires a Dockerfile. IF YOUR PROJECT DOES NOT CONTAIN A DOCKERFILE, THE DEPLOYMENT TOOL WILL AUTOMATICALLY GENERATE IT,** otherwise an existing Dockerfile will be used.

[**Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)**](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/) is a fully managed container orchestration service that helps you easily deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications.

[**AWS Fargate**](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/) is a serverless, pay-as-you-go compute engine that lets you focus on building applications without managing servers.
