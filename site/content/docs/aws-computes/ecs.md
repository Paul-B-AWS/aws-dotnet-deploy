#Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) using AWS Fargate

* Supports deployments of .NET applications as a service or as a scheduled task to Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) with compute power managed by AWS Fargate serverless compute engine..
* Recommended if you want to deploy a service or a scheduled task as a container image on Linux.

> **Note: This compute requires a Dockerfile. IF YOUR PROJECT DOES NOT CONTAIN A DOCKERFILE, THE DEPLOYMENT TOOL WILL AUTOMATICALLY GENERATE IT,** otherwise an existing Dockerfile will be used.

[**Amazon ECS**](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/) is a fully managed container orchestration service that helps you easily deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications. It deeply integrates with the rest of the AWS platform to provide a secure and easy-to-use solution for running container workloads in the cloud and now on your infrastructure with Amazon ECS Anywhere.

[**AWS Fargate**](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/) is a serverless, pay-as-you-go compute engine that lets you focus on building applications without managing servers. AWS Fargate is compatible with both Amazon Elastic Container Service (https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/?pg=ln&sec=hiw) (ECS) and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (https://aws.amazon.com/eks/?pg=ln&sec=hiw) (EKS).
