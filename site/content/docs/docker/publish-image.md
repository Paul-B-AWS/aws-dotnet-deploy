# Pushing a Docker image to Amazon ECR repository

If your application contains an existing Dockerfile, you can build and push your container images to an Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) repository using **"Push Container Images to Amazon Elastic Container Registry"** deployment option.

To learn more about Amazon ECR, including required IAM permissions for pushing an image, see [Amazon ECR product page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/image-push.html).
